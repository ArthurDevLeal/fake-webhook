# Task List Application

This project is a **React** application that allows users to manage a task list. It includes features for adding, removing, and synchronizing tasks using **localStorage**. The application is structured with a reducer for managing the task list and supports cross-tab synchronization using browser events.

## Features

- **Add tasks**: Users can input tasks, which are added to the list when submitted.
- **Remove tasks**: Each task has a delete option to remove it from the list.
- **Persist data in localStorage**: The task list is stored in local storage, allowing the data to persist across page reloads.
- **Cross-tab sync**: Changes made in one browser tab are automatically updated in other open tabs using the `storage` event.

## Usage
